            <h2>Toji Fushiguro</h2>
        </b>
        <div id="para1"><b>
                <p>Toji is an assassin who's garnered the name "Sorcerer Killer" and spends his time gambling between
                    assignments from shady clients.[4] Toji even planned on selling Megumi to the Zenin clan he had left
                    behind, believing that this would warrant a better future for his son due the cursed technique he
                    would eventually inherit.
                    Toji doesn't question his client's motives as long as the money is right and generally doesn't do
                    any extra work for free. He's bold and dangerously calculated in his strategies, using his jujutsu
                    knowledge to outwit even the most prophesized sorcerers. This garnered him a reputation large enough
                    to attract the attention of the wealthy Time Vessel Association for such an important job that could
                    ensure their future. While he thought the religious members of the organization were crazy, he got
                    along well enough with their middleman to invite him to eat.</p>

        </b>
        <div id="para2"><b>
                <p>Megumi is a very outwardly stoic, aloof, and calculating individual. He usually has a neutral facial
                    expression that he rarely changes, making it appear as if he takes every situation seriously. This
                    contrasts heavily with Yuji, Nobara, and Satoru's outgoing and goofy personalities, which often
                    annoy Megumi. He's easily irritated and Yuji has noted that Megumi seems like he's always slightly
                    angry.
                    Even as a child, Megumi was very stern, earnest, and thoughtful, to the point where Satoru
                    questioned if he was a first-grader when they first met. He didn't care for his father and assumed
                    he and Tsumiki were abandoned. Megumi understood his situation with the Zenin clan and stood firm
                    that he would only cooperate if Tsumiki were happy as well.Megumi has always been annoyed by
                    Satoru's attitude ever since they first met. He didn't care for the idea of becoming a sorcerer and
                    became more jaded about it over time. By the time Megumi reached middle school, his impersonal
                    attitude had fully set in. He thought becoming a jujutsu sorcerer would be pointless as he didn't
                    see himself as someone who saves others. Uninterested in making friends, Megumi believed the basis
                    of human interaction was avoiding violating someone else's dignity. He would beat up school bullies
                    who ignored this rule to feed their egos, gaining a reputation as the biggest troublemaker in school
                    as a result. Tsumiki wanted him to stop getting in fights but Megumi didn't listen and wrote her
                    off.
                    Megumi hated bad people with unearned pride just as much as he did good people who were too merciful
                    to the former. Tsumiki was a perfect example of a good person to Megumi but he would disagree with
                    and get annoyed with her anytime she scolded him for hurting someone bad. After Tsumiki fell into an
                    unending sleep, Megumi realized he was acting immaturely. He knew Tsumiki was choosing to protect
                    and that she believed that his lack of forgiveness was his way of showing kindness. After Tsumiki
                    was cursed, Megumi was filled with regret and found the drive to become a sorcerer so he could save
                    her

            <h2>Itadori Yuji/Kugisaki Nobara/Megumi Fushiguro</h2>
        </b>
        <div id="para3"><b>
                <p>Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara are first-year students at the Jujutsu High. Nobara and Yuji seem to match
                    each other’s energy quite often, especially if it’s excitement, though they often bicker and argue
                    on mundane things, while Megumi waits for them to get over it without interrupting. Reserved and
                    serious Megumi makes a good contrast to always enthusiastic and reckless Yuji and Nobara. They
                    frequently compel him to join them on their adventurous undertakings — he looks reluctant, but
                    always indulges them anyway.</p>
